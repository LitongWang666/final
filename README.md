# **User research and interviews**

- **Question 1:** How often do you use TikTok, and how much time do you spend on it daily?
- **Question 2:** Have you ever purchased a product recommended by an influencer? What was your experience like?
- **Question 3:** How do you perceive the speed of information dissemination and content quality on TikTok? Are there any ads or information you find untrustworthy?
- **Question 4:** What are your thoughts on the influencer economy, especially large influencers like "Xiao Yang Ge"?
- **Question 5:** If you could change one thing about TikTok, what would it be?

### Participant 1: 25 years old, active social media user

- **Question 1:** I use TikTok every day, about 2-3 hours mainly during my break times, watching funny videos or trending news.
- **Question 2:** Yes, I’ve bought several influencer-recommended products, but the experience was mediocre. One time I bought a beauty product, and the actual effect was far from what was shown in the live stream, so I returned it.
- **Question 3:** The speed of information dissemination on TikTok is incredibly fast, and you can catch trending news almost instantly. However, the content quality varies a lot. There are many ads and false promotions that are quite annoying.
- **Question 4:** The influencer economy has created a lot of business opportunities, but some influencers over-exaggerate their promotions just to sell products. For influencers like Xiao Yang Ge, while they have strong selling power, I don't fully trust their recommendations, as it feels more like they’re just trying to sell.
- **Question 5:** I hope TikTok would strengthen its review of ads and influencer content, so false promotions don’t become so rampant.

### Participant 2: 35 years old, e-commerce consumer

- **Question 1:** I use TikTok around four or five times a week, about an hour each time, mainly to check out updates from friends and some funny videos.
- **Question 2:** I’ve bought several products recommended by influencers, mostly household items. The experience was generally fine and the prices were good, but once I bought clothing, and the quality was really bad. Returning the item was also quite a hassle.
- **Question 3:** The information spreads very quickly on TikTok, but the content quality needs improvement. Some of the products being recommended are clearly overhyped, especially health-related items—it’s hard to distinguish what’s real.
- **Question 4:** I think the influencer economy is a growing trend, and influencers like Xiao Yang Ge have significant influence, but I’m cautious about trusting their recommendations. It feels like many of the promotions are driven by businesses behind the scenes.
- **Question 5:** I hope TikTok would implement stricter regulations for influencer marketing to ensure the products they recommend are of good quality. That would make me more willing to trust them.

### Participant 3: 30 years old, short video content creator

- **Question 1:** I use TikTok every day, around 3-4 hours, since as a content creator, I need to stay updated on trends and hot topics.
- **Question 2:** I haven’t personally bought anything recommended by influencers because I know many tricks of live-stream sales. As a creator myself, I understand how they exaggerate products, and often the descriptions are over the top.
- **Question 3:** Information spreads very quickly on TikTok, but it’s hard to guarantee the authenticity of the content. Especially in product promotions, many of the descriptions are overly polished, and users can easily be misled.
- **Question 4:** As a creator, I understand the pressure to promote products, but I believe big influencers like Xiao Yang Ge should be more responsible. Their recommendations have a huge impact, and they should be accountable to consumers, not just focused on profits.
- **Question 5:** I hope TikTok would improve its algorithm to push more quality content rather than just focusing on traffic and engagement metrics. Too much low-quality influencer content gets highlighted.

### Participant 4: 40 years old, e-commerce professional

- **Question 1:** I don’t use TikTok much daily, around half an hour, mainly to follow market trends and check competitors’ performances in influencer marketing.
- **Question 2:** I haven’t personally bought anything recommended by influencers, but I know many consumers buy through these channels. As a business owner, we consider collaborating with influencers, but we have to be selective because the quality of recommendations varies a lot.
- **Question 3:** TikTok spreads information very efficiently, but the content quality needs to be improved. Especially in the influencer-driven sales space, many products’ actual quality doesn’t match their promotion, which over time erodes consumer trust.
- **Question 4:** The influencer economy is a double-edged sword. Influencers like Xiao Yang Ge can quickly boost sales, but without quality control, it may damage the credibility of the entire industry in the long run.
- **Question 5:** I hope TikTok introduces a more transparent review system for influencer-promoted products, allowing consumers to easily see real feedback from others instead of just relying on influencer sales pitches.

# My Take and Improvement Plan

Through the interviews, it became clear that while TikTok (Douyin) is extremely effective in rapidly disseminating information and engaging users, there are significant concerns around content quality and the credibility of influencer marketing. Most participants expressed dissatisfaction with the exaggerated claims made by influencers, particularly in the e-commerce sector. Trust in influencer-driven sales is waning, as several participants recounted poor experiences with products that didn’t match expectations, leading to increased return rates and complaints. Furthermore, while influencers like Xiao Yang Ge can drive significant sales, the long-term impact of inconsistent product quality could damage consumer trust and, in turn, the platform's credibility.

The findings also revealed that TikTok users are frustrated by the overwhelming number of ads and questionable promotions, which undermines their trust in the platform. Additionally, there’s a call for stronger regulations and quality control mechanisms to ensure that the products promoted by influencers meet a certain standard of quality and that the platform's algorithm prioritizes trustworthy content.

# Targeted Audience

The primary audience for this data visualization story is:

1. **Active Social Media Users (Aged 18-40)**: This group represents frequent TikTok users who engage with the platform daily, either consuming content or making purchases influenced by popular influencers. They are likely to have encountered both the benefits and challenges of TikTok’s rapid information dissemination and influencer marketing.
2. **E-commerce Shoppers**: These individuals have experience purchasing products through influencer marketing, particularly on platforms like TikTok. They have a vested interest in understanding the quality of products being promoted and the reliability of the influencers they follow. This audience is directly impacted by the issues of trust and product quality raised in the interviews.
3. **Marketers and E-commerce Professionals**: Those working in the e-commerce or digital marketing space who either collaborate with influencers or plan to. This group will be interested in how influencer marketing impacts consumer behavior and platform trust, as well as in identifying potential long-term risks in relying heavily on influencer promotions.
4. **Regulators and Policy Makers**: Individuals or organizations involved in digital content regulation and consumer protection. They will be particularly interested in understanding how influencer-driven marketing impacts consumers and what measures might be taken to improve transparency, product quality, and consumer trust.

By targeting these groups, the story will not only provide insights into the current state of TikTok and influencer marketing but also propose a clear path forward to improving the platform’s reliability and enhancing the user experience.

# Improvement Plan:

1. **Visualizing Declining Trust and Consumer Feedback**: I will integrate a visualization that shows the increase in return rates, complaints, and declining trust in influencer marketing over time. This will highlight the growing dissatisfaction among consumers due to inconsistent product quality and false advertising.
2. **Content Quality vs. Information Dissemination Speed**: A comparative chart will be added to juxtapose the speed of information dissemination on TikTok with user feedback on content quality. This will help demonstrate that while the platform excels in spreading information, content reliability is often compromised.
3. **Incorporating Product Quality Ratings**: A key visualization improvement will be the addition of data showcasing product quality ratings versus influencer recommendations. This will include real user reviews and ratings to give a more nuanced view of how influencer-promoted products perform in reality.
4. **Algorithmic Influence and Platform Governance**: A forecast will be developed to explore future trends in TikTok’s platform governance, including predictions about stricter regulations on influencer content and product promotions. This will provide a forward-looking view of how TikTok might address the quality and trust issues identified.
